4122	Since Hubo has two ways to turn to the right, it seems to be relatively complex to determine which direction to go with a discrete turning function so I used such a function. And since the go-forward function is a function that goes forward from diagonal to the right and then from diagonal to the left, x was used to determine whether Hubo was moving down or up and y was used to remove a residual diagonal.

8163	In task 3, the way I implemented it was by creating this condition for only moving left, right, up and down. The while loop that the one_loop function checks for beeper is a separate action, and if there is no beeper, it just moves one space after the condition.So, if the beeper exists, repeats move and pick, but repeats pick if the beeper is not in the space.And if left, right, up and down don't exist, it finishes to close the loop.After it finished the loop, it finished the rest.
